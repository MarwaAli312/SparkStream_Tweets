# SparkStream_Tweets
These scripts read online streams from Twitter using Python, then process the tweets using Apache Spark Streaming to identify hashtags.
First of all you need to register on TwitterApps and generate the access token, access secret, consumer key and consumer secret and affect them to the variables below:
ACCESS_TOKEN = 'YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN'
ACCESS_SECRET = 'YOUR_ACCESS_SECRET'
CONSUMER_KEY = 'YOUR_CONSUMER_KEY'
CONSUMER_SECRET = 'YOUR_CONSUMER_SECRET'
